# cnn-pruning

 This repository is a PyTorch implementation of the taylor expansion criterion found in [*Pruning Convolutional Neural Networks for Resource Efficient Inference*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.06440.pdf) and tests the performance of a simple CNN model with only 4 convolutional layers on CIFAR100.
